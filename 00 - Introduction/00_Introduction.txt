■ Data
----
- Data refers to way, unprocessed facts, figures, and symbols that represent the characteristics 
  or properties of an object, event or phenomenon.
- Examples – Student A: age – 15, grade – 9, CGPA – 9.5


■ Information
-----------
- Information is collection of processed and organized data that has been transformed into a 
  meaningful and useful form for a specific purpose.
- Examples – Contact information of student’s parents, average age of CSE student

■ Database
----------
- A database is an organized collection of data stored electronically, so that it can be easily 
  accessed and managed.
- It can contain any type of data including words, numbers, images, videos, and files.

==========================================================================================================

■ DBMS
------  
- Database management system is a software application that provides an organized and efficient way 
  to store, manage, and retrieve data in a database.
- It serves as an interface between the database and the users. 
- By using DBMS, we can perform CRUD (Crate, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a database.
- Overall, DBMS plays a crucial role in managing data efficiently, ensuring its integrity and security, 
  and providing a convenient interface for users and applications to interact with the sored information.
- Examples:
    ○ RDBMS Examples: MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, MariaDB
    ○ NoSQL DBMS Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis, Amazon DynamoDB

● Data Model Types in DBMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1> Ralational Data Model
    2> Entity Relationship Data Model
    3> Semi Structured Data Model
    4> Hierarchical Data Model
    5> Network Data Model
    6> Object Oriented Data Model

    1> Relational Data Model
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - Relational model is an approach to organize and representing data in a structured way, using tables 
      with rows and columns.
    - Relational model was introduced by Edgar Frank Codd (E. F. Codd) in the year 1970.
    - He established the main rule that the data has to be stored in tabular form.

==========================================================================================================

■ RDBMS
-------
- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
- It is a type of Database Management System (DBMS), the follows the principles of the relation model, 
  which was introduced by Edgar Codd. 
- In an RDBMS, data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and Relationships between tables are 
  established using keys.
- Examples: - MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, MariaDB.

● Key Features of RDBMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1> Tables
    ~~~~~~~~~
    - Data is stored in tables, where each table consists or rows (records or tuples) and columns 
      (attributes or fields).

    2> Relationships
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - RDBMS allows the establishment of relationships between tables using keys, such as primary keys and 
      foreign keys.

    3> ACID Properties
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - RDBMS follows to the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring the 
      reliability and consistency of transactions.

    4> SQL
    ~~~~~~
    - SQL is used to interact with RDBMS, providing a standardized language for defining, querying, and 
      manipulating data.

    5> Data Integrity
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - RDBMS enforces data integrity through constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, and unique 
      constraints.

● Table
~~~~~~~
- A table is a fundamental structure used to organize and store data.
- It is a two-dimensional representation of data where information is organized in rows and columns.

    ○ Rows (records or tuples)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - Each row in a table represents a record or specific set of related data.
    - It contains data values corresponding to different attributes or columns.

    ○ Columns (attributes or fields)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - Each column in a table represents a specific attribute or field. 
    - It defines the type of information stored in that particular aspect of the data.

    ○ Cells
    ~~~~~~~
    - The intersection of a row and column is called a cell.
    - Each cell contains a single data value.

● SQL
~~~~~
- SQL stands for Structure Queary Language.
- It is a standard programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases.
- Basically, it is used to do CRUD operation in a Relational Databased Management System (RDBMS).
- CRUD:-
    o Create (Insert)
    o Read (Select)
    o Update (Modify)
    o Delete (Drop)
- SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s 
  after learning about the relational model from Edgar F. Codd.
- It was initially known as the Structured English Query Language (SEQUEL). The term was later shortened 
  to SQL.

==========================================================================================================

● Keyword
---------
- Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning and are used to perform specific operations of 
 functions. 

    o CONNECT (Keyword)
    ~~~~~~~~~
    - CONNECT keyword in SQL is used int the context of managing user privileges.
    - It is used to grant the privilege to connect to a database to a specific user or role.
    - Syntax: - 
        CONNECT
        Enter username: 
        Enter password: 

        CONNECT username
        Enter password: 

    o SHOW USER
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    - It is used to display the current user we are logged in as.
    - Syntax: -
        SHOW USER

    o SELECT * FROM TAB
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - This command is used to list all tables, views, and synonyms accessible to the current user 
      in a database.
    
    o DESC (Keyword)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - This keyword is used to describe the structure of a table.
    - Syntax: -
        DESC tableName
